# Question 1

## Part A

I initially approached this question after spending possibly 10-15 minutes of just reading, and I did not feel like I fully grasped the content either.

This led me to make a mistake:

- I did not use the company object to updateDogs in my original solution.

I have updated and fixed this in my revised solution, and I understand that reading and understanding documentation is one of my weaknesses.

## Part B

Part B of Question 1 was slightly more simple for me to understand, and I only remember making one error which **I did correct later on**.

I created a boolean variable for calculating the bonus as it was simpler for me to gather my thoughts on the question rather than coding it in the if statement.
