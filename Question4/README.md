# Questio n4

## Part A

Part A was super simple, just used knowledge of how to make a random number and how to traverse every element in a 2D Array.

## Part B

Part B was more complicated, I used two for-loops again to traverse the 2D Array.

I set the for loop variable i = r because I realized that it only checks the rows equal to or below the number and the second variable j was used for every column.

The if statement just required typing out the location and then I returned true after setting the pairs to 0.
