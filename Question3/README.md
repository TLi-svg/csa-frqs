# Question 3

## Part A

Part A was simple, it just needed a single for loop to create each competitor and add them to the ArrayList.

## Part B

Part B was the main chunk of the question, and I created two for loops for my solution.

My initial idea was to create an if-else to determine the odd or even length of the list and then create two for-loops starting at different points based off of that.

I think that I forgot to divide the size by 2 when creating the for loop, which would lead to each match being added twice. This is fixed in my revised solution.
