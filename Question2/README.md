# Question 2

## Constructor

The Constructor was simple, it just needed two parameters and setting the private instance variables to those two parameters.

## getSignature()

getSignature() was also very simple, it was a single if else statement.

## addSignature()

addSignature() was the most troubling section of the question. I **think** I made a mistake mixing up the order of the indexOf() method.

I created variables for the signature and signature length to lessen how much I needed to type.

The condition for the signature appearing at the end gave me the most trouble.
