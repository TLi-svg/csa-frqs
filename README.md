# FRQS for AP CSA 2025 Exam

My solutions to the 2025 FRQs. [Questions found here](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-computer-science-a/exam/past-exam-questions).

## Introduction

These are my solutions to the AP CSA Exam taken on 2025/05/07.

I have documented my approach to the questions, errors that I remember making and highlighted some areas for future growth.

## Exam Experience


### Preparation

My initial thoughts on the exam were mostly positive. I struggled only on a few of the multiple choice questions, and the Free-Response Questions felt simple enough.

- I prepared by:
  - Reviewing multiple choice questions
  - Making sure I fully understood the compareTo() method, as I was not confident in my usage of it.

I also felt that **I did not review enough** for the exam, as I prioritized studying for my AP Government exam which was the day prior. I was more confident for CSA, which led me to not study as much.

### Challenges

The only challenges I remember facing were my thoroughness of the questions.

I struggled with **working through and tracing the code** and my confidence that I had arrived at the right answer after traversing the code

I also needed to work on **reading the documentation** and remembering the methods and classes provided in the Free-Response Questions.

## Resources

I learn best from:

- Visual Examples
- Text/Reading Explanations
- Trying out solutions and getting feedback

These strengths made some resources more accessible and helpful.

Some of the major resources that I believe helped was:

- The Mock Exam
  - Being able to work through an actual test helped me find what I was comfortable with
  - [Juicemind](https://www.juicemind.com/)
    - Juicemind was a great help with practice for the FRQs
    - The AI feedback helped me **understand what I did wrong**, and I was able to read through.
    - I did feel that the AI was inaccurate at times however, but that can change overtime.
- Princeton Review Book
  - I believe the review book was helpful **to a certain extent**
  - Personally, I did not find the content **outside of the practice exams** were helpful

## Moving Ahead

Moving forward, I have some plans and simple hobby projects I want to make.

I want to:

- Learn a different language
  - Im aiming to learn either Python or Typescript/Javascript because there are some projects I may attempt to try.
